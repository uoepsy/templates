Test questions.

The code is in dropdowns.R file, which is sourced at the start of the bookdown.	
the .css and toggling script is included in toggling.html, which is then included in_header in the yaml.

`r qbegin()`	
This is the first question.	
`r qend()`	

`r solbegin()`	
```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
```

Hello, I'm a solution.

```{r}
x <- 2 * rnorm(10)
```
`r solend()`	

`r qbegin()`	
Question again.	
`r qend()`	

`r solbegin()`	
The solution is Peppa pig. 	

I think these will just number through the whole book, so it won't reset each chapter, which is not ideal.
`r solend()`

This is a frame :)
I am trying to add more lines to see what happens.

### Frame with header h3 {-}

This is a another frame, but with a header.

<h4 style="margin: 0;"> Frame with header h4 </h4>

:::frame	
**Frame with header as bold text**

This is a another frame, but with a header.

Who knows! Lower baseline with letter g.

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
